# `/internal/service`

Representation layer of the application

Mapping of internal entities to content for the end user<br>
e.g. representing request types as `/internal/core` models and `/internal/core` models as response types; managing return status codes etc.

Note: highly recommended being versioned as depends on the versioned generated API definitions
